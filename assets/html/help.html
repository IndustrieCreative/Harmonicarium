            <h1>Short Help</h1>
            <h2>This program currently under development.</h2>
            <h2>Google Chrome (or Chromium) browser is required.</h2>
            <h3>MIDI OUT feature is unavailable at the moment.</h3>
            <p>In order to listen an OUTPUT SOUND there is the “Built-in Synth”. Its ON/OFF checkbox must be flagged.</p>
            <p>If you have a MIDI keyboard you can connect and chose it from “Input ports”.</p>
            <p>If you have NO physical MIDI keyboard you can use the “Virtual MIDI Controller” with your mouse or pressing the “<span class="monospace">qwerty</span>” and “<span class="monospace">asdfgh</span>” rows on your PC keyboard. The range is very limited due to the current JavaScript keyboard (Qwerty Hancock) that must be modded or replaced.</p>
            <p>Since this program is still in beta and its UI must be totally replaced, I cannot write an exhaustive guide at the moment. The functioning in a few words is as follows.</p>
            <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
            <p>You have two keyboard layers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fundamental Tones (FT): the<span class="monospace"> red keys</span>.</li>
                <li>Harmonic Tones (HT): the<span class="monospace"> blue keys</span>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can play the Harmonic Series on the blue keys.</p>
            <p>You can change their fundamental by pressing the red keys; the harmonics on blue keys are instantly recalculated.</p>

            </p>The program starts with the Harmonic Series of a <span class="monospace">C3</span> (<span class="monospace">130.81Hz</span>). This is the Fundamental Mother</p>
            <h3>KEYMAPS</h3>
            <p>The position of the FTs and HTs on the keyboard is set on the “Controller Keymap”. You can create your own controller keymap.</p>
            <p>In the  <a href="http://harmonicarium.org/app/keymaps/_mapping-tools" target="_blank">/keymaps/_mapping-tools/</a> folder there is the "<a href="http://harmonicarium.org/app/keymaps/_mapping-tools/keymapping-tool.xlsx" target="_blank">keymapping-tool.xlsx</a>" that can be used to generate keymaps. Other maps can be found on the <a href="http://harmonicarium.org/app/keymaps/n-edx" target="_blank">/keymaps/n-edx/</a> . You can <a href="https://github.com/IndustrieCreative/Harmonicarium/zipball/master" target="_blank">download the "offline" app</a>.</p>
            <h3>FUNDAMENTAL TONES</h3>
            <p>The FT are like a palette of frequencies available to generate harmonics. The default FT are <span class="monospace">12</span> tone equally tempered (<span class="monospace">12-TET</span> or <span class="monospace">12-EDO</span>). In the Fundamental Tones box you can edit the FT tuning. At the moment only equal temperaments are available.</p>
            <p>Since at the moment I'm writing documentation on the <a href="http://harmonicarium.org/" target="_blank">project site</a> and many options are the same of the old Harmonync, you can read <a href="http://harmonync.harmonicarium.org" target="_blank">the old site project</a> to better understand the purpose and the functioning of this program.</p>
